	How Chemistry and Molecular Biology work Together

What is Life Science?
- Chemistry in relation to life/organisms?
- Chemical reactions that organisms require to function?
- Pharma and effects on life?
What is not?
- Industrial reactions/production
- Minerals
- Sub-molecular scale is less relevant (e.g. proteins)

Context matters; is it in relation to life? --> Really broad subject


Chemistry, biology or both?
- DNA replication
- Photosynthesis in Plants
- Plastic Waste in the Ocean
- Drug Effect
- Enzyme Catalysis
- Protein Folding
- Cellular Energy
Context matters: chemistry describes cause, biology describes effect.


Take home:
- Biology gives the *context* (cells, genes, organisms)
- Chemistry gives the *mechanism* (atoms, bonds, reactions/interactions)
- Together, they explain life

Why Chemistry first?
- Toolbox for biology
- Without --> memorization only
- Explanation and understanding

Understanding concepts is more important, as it's impossible to memorize every reaction, mechanism, etc. Understand the *why*, the rest will follow.
- Understand, don't memorize
	Learn logic of reactions
- Practice often
	Solve many problems
- Visualize molecules
	Draw structures, use 3D models, and sketch mechanisms step by step
	
- Repeat and revisit
	Small, consistent study session > cramming
- Learn together
	Explaining mechanisms to others helps you understand deeply
- Ask questions early
	Don't wait until exam week. Use teachers, tutors, peers when you get stuck
