"Health is a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity" - WHO 1946

 Top 5 threats:
- Air Pollution/Climate Change
- Noncommunicable diseases (NCD) ~75 % of deaths in recent years, such as,
	- Cardiovascular, cancer, CRD, diabetes, obesity.
	- Disproportionally affects low- to middle-income populations.
	- Global influenza pandemic
	- Fragile and vulnerable settings
	- Antimicrobial resistance
	
Diabetes:
- Rising in recent years, especially low-income countries. How?
	- Low food security --> lower quality food, less varied diets (refined carbs) leading to obesity/diabetes.
	
Northern Sweden Health and Disease Study:
- Started in Nordsjö 1985.
- More than 143 000 participants.
- Lifestyle and healthy habits counselling.

Physical Activity:
- Defined as: "Any bodily movement achieved by contraction of skeletal muscles that increases energy expenditure (EE) above resting levels"
	-  EE = Produced internal heat + external work
	- Affects:
		- CNS, well maintained cerebral blood-flow
		- Metabolism, higher liver glucose output, adipose tissue lipolysis
		- Skin, sweat, fluid homeostasis, cardiovascular function.
		- Oxygen transport
		- Skeletal muscle
	- Signaling:
		- Autocrine (self)
		- Paracrine (adjacent, nearby target cell)
		- Endocrine (distant, into bloodstream, affects whole body)

Metabolic Flexibility:
- Glucose and Fatty acids, main energy sources that we switch between
- RQ to measure. Measure CO2 in and O2 out.
	- RQ = 0.7 when 100 % lipid for ATP.
	- RQ = 0.85 when 50/50 carbs/lipids for ATP.
	- RQ = 1 when 100 % carbs for ATP.
	
How to measure physical activity?
- Accelerometry:
	- Measures movement.

Metabolic rate
- How quickly fuels are broken down to keep the organism's cells running.
- Homeostasis - maintain a stable, relatively constant internal environment.
- Metabolism = Catabolism + Anabolism
	- Catabolism: decompose energy-rich molecules to produce ATP
	- Anabolism: Consumes ATP to create energy-rich molecules

ATP:
- Mechanical work: muscle, flagell movements, body temperature
- Chemical work/Biosynthesis: synthesise new molecules, proteins, nucleic acids, lipids
- Homeostasis (not passive diffusion/transportation)

Hydrogen carriers:
- NAD+/NADH (Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide)
-
