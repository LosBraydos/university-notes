Essential for communicating results in education, science, and society
- Structured description of systematically performed experiments/studies
- It should be possible for the reader to reproduce
- Documentation throughout experiments/studies, very important!
- Who is the reader? Adjust language.

Example structure:
	1. Title and title page
	2. Abstract
	3. Contents
	4. Introduction
	5. Theory
	6. Materials and Methods (including Theory)
	7. Results (and Discussion)
	8. Discussion (and Conclusions)
	9. Conclusions
	10. References
	11. Supplementary material (Attachments)
Order can vary depending on field, e.g. in chemistry Materials may be located in Supplementary material
Methods should be justified, motivated why they are done. Why is this particular experiment being done?
Look for information on how to structure *your* report

Types of Titles:
- Method-reflecting:
	- Focuses on *how* the study was done
		*"Microscopy-based analysis of biofilm formation in E. coli"*

- Aim-reflecting
	- Focuses on *purpose*
		*"Investigating biofilm formation in E. coli under stress conditions"*

- Result-reflecting
	- Focuses on the *main finding*
		*"Nutrient limitation enhances biofilm formation in E. coli"*

- Combination
	- Mixes aim, method, or result
	- *"Microscopy reveals nutrient-dependent biofilm formation in E. coli"*

Decision of Title:
1. Start with your project focus
	- Is the emphasis on method, aim, or results?
	- What message do we want to convey?
	- Who do we want to read the report?
2. Check your results strength
	- Preliminary/uncertain? Use aim or method
	- Strong/clear? Use result or combination
3. Consider your audience
	- Teachers/examiners want clarity: aim/combination
	- Scientists/journals

Or go for a catchy fun title!
- *"When Life Gives You Lemons: Acidic pH Boosts Biofilm Formation in E. coli"*
- *"Sticky When Sour: Acidic Environments Enhance* E. coli *Biofilm Growth"*


What is an abstract?
- A short summary of the whole report, normally between 150-250 words
- Placed at the beginning but written last
- Should allow the reader to understand:
	1. Why the study was done
	2. What the aim was
	3. How it was done (brief methods)
	4. What was found
	5. What it means
- Use OCAR!
	1. Opening: what is the big picture, context?
	2. Challenge: What problem/gap does your study address?
	3. Action: What did you do (methods, briefly)?
	4. Resolution: What did you find and why does it matter?


In combination, Title and Abstract are the most important points for reaching out with your results/study!

Sometimes, headings are written out in the Abstract (e.g. Objectives:, Methods:, etc.) Look for guiding information in the journal/publisher

Introduction:
- Purpose: Sets the context and defines the aim
- Content:
	- Start broad: background and relevance
	- Narrow down to your specific question
	- State aim and hypothesis clearly
	- What method were you using and why?
- Scientific Method:
	- Hypothesis based on current knowledge
	- Experiments should be made to *disprove* the hypothesis, rather than prove it
	- Disproving hypothesis can lead to new discovery
- Overview of relevant literature

Materials and Methods:
- Detailed description of methods, protocols and strategies used to obtain the presented results
- Level of detail should allow the reader, with required skills, to exactly reproduce the experiments
- This part could include theory about the used methods. However the theory could also be a separate section prior to *Materials and Methods*.

Results:
- The results section should be a concise and clear reporting of the results
- Present results in logical order (often following aims/methods), it should be easy to understand
- Use figures and tables as a help in clarifying your results. (Only relevant figures and tables!!)
- Important!! Be objective! Only what has been actually done, avoid discussion here
- Results that do not fit or cannot be explained should still be included!

Figures and Tables:
- Figures and tables should be included to visualise data effectively and make the results clearer to the reader
- Every figure/table must have a number and a explaining text. They should always be referred to in the text
- Figure text and table heading should include all necessary information for the reader to understand the figure or table
- Use clear labels, units, and scales

Discussion:
- Interpret and explain your results
- Put results into perspective, connect back to the aims of the work
- Explain patterns, trends, unexpected findings
- Address limitations and possible errors
- How well do they match previously reported results?
- Don't just repeat the results section, add meaning!

Conclusion:
- Wrap up the study in 2-3 sentences
- Content:
	- Restate aim and main findings
	- Answer your research question clearly, what did your results show and how can this be utilised?
	- Mention broader significance or next step
	- Keep it short and focused, no new data!

Acknowledgements:
- For thanking those who contributed but are not authors
	- Supervisors, mentors, teachers
	- Lab assistants, colleagues who gave technical help
	- funding agencies or scholarships
	- Institutions providing facilities/equipment
	- Tone is formal, concise, respectful

References:
- Show where your information comes from and give credit!
- General:
	- Every statement of fact that is not your own work must be referenced
	- Use a consistent citation style (e.g. Harvard, Vancouver, APA)
	- A reference should be visible in the text next to the statement and linked to a reference list
	- References in text must match those in the list
	- Common knowledge does not need to be referenced.
- Include:
	Author(s), year, title, journal/book, volume, pages, DOI if possible

Documentation:
A core skill!
- Essential in academia and industry, make it a habit!
- Ensures accuracy and reproducibility in experiments
- Helps you track progress and learn from mistakes
- Builds credibility and professionalism in your work
- A valuable resource for reports, publications, and future project

Lab notebook:
- Flowchart
- Reagents, target, reaction
- Calculations, moles
- Procedure, properties and details (colour, consistency)
- Write down if something goes wrong!
	Include thoughts on why
