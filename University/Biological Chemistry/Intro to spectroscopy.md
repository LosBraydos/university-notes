How can we determine molecular structure?
- Before, compounds were taken apart into smaller fragments that hopefully could be identified
- Wet chemistry tests were conducted to determine functional groups![[Pasted image 20250923130548.png]]
- Spectroscopic methods are used today

Spectroscopy measures interactions between energy and material (atoms/molecules)
- Energy such as:
	- Light of different wavelengths (IR, UV, VIS)
	- High energy electrons
- Interactions:
	- Absorption/emission
	- Scattering (reveals surface properties of materials)
	- Vibration
	- Chemical changes (e.g. breaking bonds)
- Information:
	- Functional groups - IR
	- Chemical environment of certain atoms - NMR
	- Molecular mass - MS
	- Molecular fragments - MS

IR Spectroscopy Theory:
- Interactions between organic molecules and IR light
- Absorption of IR causes vibrations of chemical bonds
- Each bond type (single, double, triple, etc.) absorbs a specific wavelength
- WL depends on mass of atoms and type of chemical bond![[Pasted image 20250923131142.png]]

IR Spectroscopy Table:![[Pasted image 20250923131632.png]]

Example usage 1: Differentiating between alkenes and aromatics![[Pasted image 20250923131725.png]]
Alkane + alkene has absorption below 3000, while aromatic has absorption above 3000.

Example usage 2: Identifying presence carbonyls![[Pasted image 20250923132034.png]]
All esters has strong absorption around 1700.

Example usage 3: Nitriles![[Pasted image 20250923132144.png]]

IR - Important functional groups:
- Alkenes and aromatic groups absorbs just above 3000 cm^-1
- Carbonyls have strong absorbance around 1700 cm^-1
- Nitriles absorbs at 2200 cm^1
- Amines absorbs at 3200-3300 cm^1
- Alcohols and carboxylic acids have broad and strong absorbance at 3000-3400 cm^-1 and strong absorbance around 1700 cm^-1 in acids

NMR
- Uses the magnetic properties of some atomic nuclei
- Very powerful method is several areas
	- Structure of small organic molecules
	- Structure of proteins and peptides
	-  Protein dynamics
	- Interactions between molecules
- Gives crucial information for structure determination:
	- Chemical environment around the observed (chemical shift)
	- Direct information about nearby atoms (J-couplings)

- Based on the quantum property *spin*
- Nuclei with spin behave as magnets, with spin frequency being related to chemical structure
- Common spin nuclei: 1 H (hydrogen), 13 C (carbon), 15 N (nitrogen), 31 P (phosphorus)![[Pasted image 20250923132814.png]]
- RF is then used to manipulate the net magnetization.
- Induces a precession which can be observed when it returns to the equilibrium state (relaxation)
- FT "translates" oscillating current to a spectrum![[Pasted image 20250923133230.png]]
- Each nucleus with a unique chemical surrounding will result in a peak in the spectrum
- In complex molecules there can be several peaks.![[Pasted image 20250923133251.png]]![[Pasted image 20250923133634.png]]![[Pasted image 20250923134114.png]]

- Splitting pattern
	- Each proton can "feel" neighbouring protons (3 bonds or closer). This is called J-coupling
	- Number of peaks = number of neighbours + 1:![[Pasted image 20250923134348.png]]
	- Chemical shift is the peak position in the spectrum, and measures how much the peak is shifted relative to a standard.
		- Chemical shift is a frequency (Hz) but is translated to ppm so that all spectrometers give the same value
		- Chemical shift depends on chemical environment![[Pasted image 20250923134925.png]]
- NMR tables are not always accurate and actual results can depend on:
	- pH
	- Solvent
	- Temperature
- Tables are not always needed to determine structure
- -OH and -NH2 have often broad peaks
- Between 7-8, very likely benzene
- The solvent itself can also give peaks, especially organic solvents
- A peak of 0 ppm comes from an internal standard used for calibrating the spectrum

Mass Spectrometry (MS)
- Used to measure molecular weights
- Molecules are turned into ions that are separated and detected according to their mass and charge. This can be used to identify the molecule
- Often coupled to a chromatography system for separation of a sample mixture
- Theory:
	- Sample inlet, introduces sample either directly or from chromatography
	- Ion source converts into sample into ions and fragments
	- Mass analyser, separates the ions according to m/z (mass to charge ratio)
	- Ion detector
	- Computer, generates mass spectrum![[Pasted image 20250923142758.png]]
	- Nominal mass
		- The nearest integer mass of the most common isotopes
