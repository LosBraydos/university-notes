- Laboratory Safety
- Risk Assessment
- Laboratory Theory

Before you enter:
- Location of safety showers, eye wash, fire extinguishers, fire blankets, first aid kit.
- Risk assessment of chemicals and procedures, danger symbols.

Do not:
- Eat, drink, chew gum, smoke, snus
- Run
- Walk round with exposed syringe
- Walk around with gloves outside fume hood
- Bring outdoor clothing and bags
- Work alone (without assistants)

Must do:
- Wear a lab coat and protective glasses (PPE)
- Work in fume hood
- Immediately clean spills (even water)
- Proper labelling
- Emergency: 112

Accidents:
- Small cuts/wounds:
	Clean, bandage, hold wounded part high
- Burns
	Rinse with cold water for 15 mins (rinse with sterile 0.9% NaCl)
- Chemicals in eyes
	Remove contacts, rinse in eye shower for 2-3 minutes (Keep open)

In case of evacuation, gather outside main entrance of KBC building


Chemical waste and cleaning:
- Most should not be disposed in the sink.
- Special conatiners for flammable solvents (yellow), halogenated solvents (green)
	Rinse glassware with acetone then go to sink and wash
- Aqeuos waste (dilute acids, bases)
- Solid waste
	Dispose in boxes labeled "Riskavfall" or dissolved in acetone and disposed in the flammable waste
	Broken contaminated glassware should also be put in riskavfall
	Clean broken glass disposed in glass waste

Think about when working:
- Use common sense
- Treat chemicals with respect! (assume danger and take precautions)
- Do not pour back a chemical that you have taken too much of into the original container (contamination!) Ask if someone else need it instead
- Put on correct lid and return to correct place
- Avoid splashes when boiling. Never put boiling stones to an already warm solution
- No open flames when heating solutions, use water/oil bath
- Diluting acid (SIV) acid in water

Risk assessment:
- Name and CAS
- Physical properties (MW, Bp, Mp, Fp, Density, etc.)
- Chemical prop (Flammable, corrosive, etc.)
- Hazard identification
- Handling and first aid measures
- Disposal

Keep lab notebook!
- Very important to always keep a lab notebook when doing lab work.
- Another person should be able to repeat the steps from your book.

Purchase Lab Coats:
- KB.E2

Need to have:
- Lab coat
- Goggles
- Notebook
- Marker

Laboratory Theory:
- Extractions
	Separation technique/purification using solubility of compound in different solvents (E.g. water and DCM)
	Key: Polar compounds are soluble in water phase, while non-polar are soluble in organic phase.
	
- Acid-base extraction
	1. Add acids or bases to the solution to protonate or deprotonate compound
	2. Charged molecules are mote water-soluble and will move to water phase
	3. Separate phases
How to know which phase is which? Density!
- Density is often expressed as relative density, usually against water with a density of 1. If organic solvent has D > 1, water phase on top. If D < 1, organic phase on top.
- Add a drop of water to separation funnel to see which phase the drop goes to.
- Usually easier to remove organic solvent, evaporation. Therefore, extracted compound should be in organic solvent.

Demonstration of lab facilities at 9.15 Mon 22 september. Mandatory!
