Mechanisms of lifestyle-related diseases

Combustion:
- Activation energy + fuel + O2 -> CO2 + H2O + Heat
- Glycolysis --> Krebs Cycle --> Electron Transport Chain

Carbohydrates:
- Oxidation of glucose
	- Glucose + 2ADP + 2Pi + NAD+ --> 2Pyruvate + 2ATP + NADH
	- O2 + Krebs, ETC (Aerobic)
	- Alternative: Pyruvate + NADH + H+ --> Lactate + NAD+ (Anaerobic)

Fats, fatty acids:
- Triacylglycerol (TG) --> Fatty acids --> Acetyl-CoA --> Krebs 
- Glucose is required to sustain Krebs, some glucose is required to break down fatty acids into energy. 
- Alternative: Acetyl-CoA --> ketone bodies + CoA 

Proteins, amino acids:
- Short amino acids (3C) --> pyruvate + urea
- Long amino acids(4-5C) --> directly into intermediates of Krebs cycle. 

Exercise:
- Increase mitochondria and capillaries in muscle tissue.
- Increase tolerance of lactate and hydrogen concentration, increase transport of these
- Aerobic exercise
- Anaerobic exercise
- Lactate is mainly formed during anaerobic exercise

Diabetes:
- Normal:
	Sugar is transported from GI-tract to cells in different organs. The pancreas produces and excretes insulin into the bloodstream. The insulin works as a key which allows cells to take in glucose.
	
- Type I: No insulin is present
	Pancreas produces too little or no insulin, e.g. due to autoimmune disease damaging the pancreas.
	
- Type II: Cells are resistant to insulin
	Pancreas produces insulin normally, but cells are resistant to insulin leading to high insulin and sugar concentration in blood. Can vary in different cells and therefore affects people differently.
	


###### How do we measure Health?

Metabolites:
- Small molecules in the metabolism
- Metabolome = all the metabolites in a cell or tissue
- Novel biomarker of disease state
- Understand disease mechanisms
- Response from intervention

Metabolomics and Lipidomics
	A comprehensive analysis of the chemical processes that involves metabolites

Traditional measures of metabolic status:
- Body composition
	- BMI (kg/m^2), fat distribution, lean mass, waist circumference, saggital height, waist to hip ratio.
- Blood status
	- Blood pressure, blood lipids (triglycerides, lipoprotein fractions)

Physical activity and fitness:
- Fitness level tests
	- VO2max
	- Respiratory quotient or respiratory exchange ratio
- Accelerometry monitors
	- Capture the rate of change of velocity in 3D acceleration (physical activity level)
	- Measure sedentary behaviour (standing and sitting time)
-
