How to Give a Great Scientific Presentation - Tips for Life Science Students

Why is it important?
- Communicate discoveries
- A strong presentation makes your research memorable, help defend your thesis, and impress future employers

Core idea:
	Every good presentation tells a story, not just data
	1. Background
		What is it? Why is it important?
	2. Question
		 How can we... Hypothesis...
	3. Methods
	4. Results
	5. Conclusion
		Ideally connect to the background, answer the questions posed in the beginning

Know your audience:
- Adjust detail to fit the audience's background
	Easy to forget that the audience might not have a scientific background. Do not go too deep if not necessary
- Avoid jargon and abbreviations unless you explain it
- What does your audience know? What do they need from you?

First impressions matter:
	Your presentation starts before you speak.
- Dress appropriately for the occasion
- Think about how you want to be perceived

The Golden Rule of Slides:
- One slide = one idea
- Use minimal text, let visuals support your point
- Not too many bullets or figures
	Overloaded slides overwhelm your audience. Focused slides keep attention on you and your message
	Avoid flashy animations, bright colours, excessive text/font size

Effective Visuals:
	Use graphs, diagrams, photos, but always highlight the key point. Remove everything not essential.

Delivery:
- Don't read your slides, explain them
- Speak clearly and vary your tone
- Make eye contact and use pauses

Time Management:
- Stick to the allotted time
- Better to finish early than rush
- Always rehearse with a timer

Common Pitfalls!
- To advanced level, know your audience!
- Too much text
- Too many slides
- No clear conclusion
- Monotone delivery

Take home:
- Know your audience
- Tell a clear story
- One idea per slide
- Simple visuals, no text walls
- Practice = confidence
