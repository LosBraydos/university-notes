DNA
- Deoxyribonucleic acid
- A,C,G,T
- Contains genetic information, human cells have more than 3 billion base pairs

- Long chain of sub-units called **nucleotides**
- Each nucleotide is comprised of:
	- a sugar: deoxyribose
	- an organic base
	- a phosphate group -PO4

	Each organic base are either adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and thymine (T).
	They form complementary pairs:
	- A with T (with double hydrogen bonds)
	- C with G (with triple hydrogen bonds)
	A and G are **purines**, T and C are **pyrimidines**.

	Phosphate group link together nucleotides (sugar + base)

	DNA chains form a double helix with major groove and minor groove. Grooves are formed by unequal spacing between phosphate-sugars. Major grooves are more accessible to proteins than minor grooves.

	Where is DNA located?
	- Prokaryotic cell:
		- Bacterial chromosomal DNA and plasmid DNA. Not covered.
	- Eukaryotic cell:
		- In chromosomes in the cell nucleus. Tightly packed together.

DNA replication:
- Replication is always done from 5' to 3'.

Central Dogma:
DNA is converted to mRNA which is used to build proteins.
1. DNA replication
2. Transcription
3. Translation
mRNA is read by ribosome in groups of three, **codons**. Codons are matched with corresponding amino acids which form a chain and folds into the protein.

RNA uses **uracil** instead of **thymine**

RNA is single stranded, different from DNA which is double stranded. RNA also uses ribose instead of deoxyribose.

Forensics:
 0.2 % of the DNA sequence in humans are unique between individuals. 
 - Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) is a common type of genetic variation where a single nucleotide differs in a sequence when compared with several individuals.
- Bases might also be added or removed (insertions and deletions)
- Short Tandem Repeats (STRs) are regions in DNA where a sequence is repeated consecutively several times. The number of repeats can differ between individuals.


Forensic Science is used for the purpose of law
- Uses science and technology to investigate crime and solve cases
- Includes many areas of science:
	- Pathology
	- Chemistry
	- Toxicology
	- Psychology
	- etc.
- Edmond Locard, Father of forensic science
	- Locard's exchange principle - "Every contact leaves a trace"
