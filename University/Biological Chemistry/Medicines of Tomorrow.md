Background:
	Organic chemistry
	Bacteria and antibiotics
	Drug development

Perform a detailed investigation on the discovery and identification of new drugs
Focus is not on deep theoretical knowledge about all processes and techniques used.

Steps (details on Canvas!):
1. Lab part 1, Extraction
	Extract/separate a mixture of organic compounds
	
2. Lab part 2, Bioassay
	Test which of these compounds have an antibacterial effect
	
3. Identification, Spectroscopy
	MS, NMR, IR to determine structure
	
4. Lab part 3, Synthesis
	Synthesize the compound
	Run spectroscopy to confirm identity and test again on bacteria to confirm antibacterial effect
	
5. Seminar, Oral presentation
	Write lab note book and hand in to assistants
	Practical examination

All Lab Work is Mandatory! Record attendance

Preparations:
	Read through the instruction beforehand. Draw flowcharts!
	Prepare risk assessment before you enter the lab

Extraction:
	A method to separate different compounds based on solubility in two different non-mixable/immiscible solvents, usually water and organic solvent.
	Water is polar and dissolves polar compounds.
	Organic solvents (ether, ethyl acetate, etc.) are non-polar and dissolve non-polar compounds.
	Polar compounds often contain many oxygens, nitrogens, such as H2O, NH3.
	Ionic compounds tend to be water-soluble.
	Non-polar compounds contain mainly carbos and hydrogens, such as benzene.
	Neutral compounds are soluble in organic solvents.
	Acids and bases can be used to make a molecule ionic or neutral! They will change phases.

Bioassay - Antibacterial testing
	E. coli, commonly found in the intestines of animals. Most strains are harmless but some can cause infections and food poisoning. Can survive outside the body which makes it suitable for biological testing.

Seminar
	Short background of the problem
	descr of methods used
	results
		prepare time to present results


Lab note book
- Date and name of the lab
- Descr about what you are going to do - flowchart good
- Risk assessmenet
- Detailed step by step instru of what you are actually doing with time points, amounts of chemical used, temperature.
