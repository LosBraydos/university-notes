1. How Society Shapes Science (Science and Society)
	
	• Funding and priorities: Science progresses along the lines society values and funds. Wars, markets, politics, and ethics determine what is researched — e.g., nuclear energy during WW2, or biotechnology today.
	
	• Cultural influence: Scientists are products of their societies. Their beliefs, values, and social contexts shape what they choose to study — illustrated by Joseph Rotblat (ethical stance on nuclear weapons), Richard Levins (socialist influence on ecological research), and Henrietta Leavitt (limited by gender norms).
	
	• Societal needs drive research: Epidemics, energy crises, and public interests guide scientific focus — from HIV/AIDS research to renewable energy.
	
	• Individual action: Citizens can influence science through voting, advocacy, or participation in citizen science.



1. How Science Shapes Society_(What Has Science Done for You Lately?).
	
	• Everyday impact: Science underpins nearly every modern convenience — from electricity and medicine to agriculture and clean water.
	
	• Technological progress: Basic discoveries lead to revolutionary technologies. The story of the cathode ray tube → X-rays → DNA structure → forensics shows how ideas evolve and interconnect.
	
	• Medicine and health: Scientific discoveries like insulin and penicillin transformed healthcare, extending and improving life.
	
	• Informed decision-making: Science helps people make rational choices about health, environment, and consumption (e.g., hand-washing, sustainable fish, energy-efficient cars).
	
	• Public policy: Science informs laws and regulations that promote public health and safety (e.g., vaccination requirements, ozone protection, disaster warnings).
	
	• Mutual feedback: Science produces knowledge: society decides how to use it. sometimes for benefit (medicine. energy) and sometimes harm (weapons).
