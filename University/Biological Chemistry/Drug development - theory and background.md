Bacteria:
Can have many different shapes
Exist almost everywhere and up to 50 % of the cells in a human can be bacteria.
1-2 kg of bacteria exist in the gut.
They divide every 20 min. In only 48 hours, one bacterium can divide into over 100^73 bacteria!
Bacteria have small propellers (flagellum) with which they can move and spread across surfaces.	Some bacteria cause harm, but the majority are "good" and also play crucial roles in health. The microbiome of the gut are responsible for vitamin production, metabolism of carbohydrates and fatty acids,  stimulate the immune system, etc.
- Types of bacteria:
	- Cocci (spherical)
	- Bacilli (cylindrical)
	- Streptococci (chains)
	- Staphylococci (clusters)
	
- Types of drugs:
	- Bacteriostatic
		Inhibits growth of bacteria
	- Bactericidal
		Kills bacteria
	 
 - Classification:
	- Gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
	- Gram's test:
		- Staining procedure for identifying bacteria
		1. Stains the cells purple
		2. Wash (decolourise) with organic solvent
		3. Stain the cells red
		- Gram-negative: Easily decolourised and will be coloured red in the end.
		- Gram-positive: Are not decolourised and remains purple.
	
- Antibacterial agents
	- Sulphonamides:
		- Sulphamethoxazole + trimethoprim = co-trimoxazole
		- Agents inhibit different enzymes in same synthetic pathway
	
- Antibiotic resistance mechanisms:
	- Efflux: foreign substances are ejected from bacteria
	- Immunity and bypass: Multiple ways to produce same needed compounds
	- Target modification: changes the way the cell functions
	- Inactivating enzymes: directly inactivates or destroys antibiotics

Drug Discovery and Development:
- Therapeutic index - how safe a drug is:
	- Compare the dose levels that leads to toxic effects at 50 % of the cases with the dose levels that leads to a maximum therapeutic effect in 50 % of the cases
	- High therapeutic index mean a large safety margin
	
- What and where is the drug target?
	- In a virus?
	- Bacteria?
	- Cells?
	- Membrane?
	- The brain?
	- The stomach?
	- The gut?
	- Depending on the target, there can be different obstacles and opportunities
	
- Drug discovery process:
	1. Identify disease
	2. Validate pharmaceutical target
	3. Identify lead molecules
	4. Optimise lead molecules
	5. Preclinical trials
	6. Clinical trials
	7. Approval and distribution
	
- Pharmacokinetics:
	- What the body does to the drug
		ADME: Absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion
	
- Pharmacodynamics:
	- What the drug does to the body
		Drug-receptor interaction, nature, intensity, and duration of the biological response
	
- Clinical trials:
	Phase I: Healthy volounteers
	Phase II: Small group of patients
	Phase III: Larger group of patients
	Phase IV: The drug is placed on the market
	
	FDA, EMA
