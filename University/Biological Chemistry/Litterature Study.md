How to read a paper:
1. Skim through
2. Read the first and last paragraph of the introduction. Highlight the "why".
3. Read the first and last paragraph of the discussion. Highlight the "what".
4. Review the material and methods. What and how did they study to be able to address the stated question and draw their conclusions?
5. What did the author state as study limitations and did they pinpoint/address new questions (the need for further studies)?
