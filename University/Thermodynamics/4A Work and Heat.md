*Heat* and *Work* are two ways that energy can be transferred. 
In Thermodynamics, the world is divided into two parts:
- The *system*: region of interest, such as a flash of gas, reaction mixture, muscle fibre.
- The *surroundings*: everything else outside the system. Observations take place in the surroundings of the energy transferred in and out of the system. 
- System and Surroundings make up *Universe*.
Changes are normally localised to just around the system and only the *immediate* surroundings need to be observed.

# Three kinds of systems:
- Open system: Exchanges both matter and energy with the surroundings.
- Closed system: Exchanges only energy with the surroundings.
- Isolated system: No matter or energy can be exchanged with the surroundings.

# Work
Work is the process of achieving motion against an opposing force.
	Work = opposing force * distance moved
Work is measured in *joules* (J), with $1J=1\operatorname{kg}\cdot m^2\cdot s^{-2}$

*Energy* is the capacity of a system to do *work*. A system being able to do a lot of work equates to possessing a lot of energy. When a system does work on its surroundings, work capacity is reduced and thus energy has decreased. When work is done on a system, work capacity increases and likewise energy increases. 
The total energy store of a system is called the *Internal Energy*, *U*. The absolute internal energy includes the energies of all its components: atoms, electrons, nuclei; and would be too complex to measure. The change in internal energy, $\Delta U$, is used instead. If 15 J of energy was used to perform work (by the system), then $\Delta U=-15$ J.
$w$ is used to denote energy transferred to a system via work and, if no other form of energy transfer takes place, $\Delta U=w$. Energy transferred *to* a system means increase in internal energy and $w$ is positive. As energy leaves a system through work, $w$ becomes negative as internal energy decreases. E.g. when a system does 40 J of work, $w=-40J$ and $\Delta U=-40J$.

There are two kinds of work:
###### Expansion Work
Work via change in volume of the system. The simplest example: work done by a gas in a cylinder fitted with a piston. The opposing force is the external pressure. To find out the work, two formulae are used:
1. $W=F\cdot d$, Work = Force × Distance
2. $P_{ex}=\frac{F}{A}$, Pressure = Force / Area
Force due to pressure can be attained by rearranging 2.
   $P_{ex}=\frac{F}{A}\Rightarrow F=P_{ex}\cdot A$
And is then combined with 1. to get:
   $W=P_{ex}\cdot A\cdot d$
If external pressure and area is assumed to be constant, then the work done by the gas (the system) is dependent on the distance the piston is pushed. Further simplified:
   $W=-P_{ex}\cdot\Delta V$
As $\Delta{V}$ is positive (an increase in volume, expansion), $W$ is negative as work is being done by the system and therefore the sign becomes important.

When the pressure is equal to 0, as in a vacuum, no work is done as there is no opposing force to push against. Expansion against zero pressure is called *free expansion*.
##### Non-expansion work
Work that does not involve any change in volume

##### Reversible vs irreversible processes
In short, a reversible process can take place in either direction, while an irreversible process cannot be undone. A reversible process can be reversed by *infinitesimal* change in some variable. In the piston example, if the external pressure exactly matches the pressure of the gas in the system, the piston doesn't move (equilibrium). If however, the external pressure changes by an infinitesimal amount in either direction then the piston will move in the corresponding direction; increased pressure, piston moves in; decreased pressure, piston moves out. When further change is made, the system is in equilibrium. This is an ideal process that very rarely happens in real life. 

In an irreversible process, the system isn't in equilibrium and will generally change in one direction. An infinitesimal change will generally also not affect the process in any direction. In the piston example, if the external pressure is significantly lower than the gas, an infinitesimal change will not cause the piston to reverse.

The simplest kind of reversible change is the reversible, isothermal expansion of an ideal gas. Work is calculated by:

The greatest work is done for a process that takes place reversibly.

# Heat
The internal energy of a system can change by transferring energy with the surroundings in the form of **heat**. 
Heat is the energy transferred as a result of a temperature difference. Heat flows from high temperature to low temperature. In other words, if the system is not thermally insulated and is cooler than the surroundings, energy will flow into the system as heat; internal energy increases.
Energy transferred to the system as heat is denoted *q*. If only heat is contributing to internal energy and no other process is taking place, $\Delta U=q$. *q* is positive as heat *enters* the system and internal energy *increases*, and is negative when heat *leaves* the system and internal energy *decreases*. Heat, like energy, is measured in joules. Another common unit for heat is *calorie*, cal. 1 cal = 4.184 J. The nutritional calorie, Cal (note capitalisation), is 1 kcal.
A process that releases heat into the surroundings is an *exothermic process*. A process that absorbs heat from the surroundings is an *endothermic process*. 
There are two types of boundaries that separates a system from its surroundings:
- An *adiabatic* wall does not allow heat transfer even if there is a temperature difference between the system and its surroundings. It is *thermally insulating*.
- A *diathermic* wall does allow heat transfer between the system and its surroundings. 
A change in temperature of a system can be related to the amount of heat supplied via the *heat capacity*, *C*.
$$C=\frac{q}{\Delta T}$$
Rearranged as $\Delta T=\frac{q}{C}$, a high heat capacity means only a small rise in temperature for a given amount of heat; i.e. a lot of energy has to be put in in order for a substance to increase in temperature. 
When the system and surroundings are the same temperature, the transfer of heat is a *[[Table of Constants and Formulae#^5f3e11|reversible process]]*; e.g. an infinitesimal increase in temperature in the surroundings will cause an infinitesimal increase in temperature of the system. When the temperature of both are the same they are said to be in thermal equilibrium. This type of equilibrium is *dynamic*. 
Heat capacity is an extensive property, the more you have of something, the more energy is required to raise the temperature. It is therefore useful to describe heat capacity in the form of:
- Specific heat capacity: $C_{s}=\frac{C}{m}$
- Molar heat capacity: $C_{m}=\frac{C}{n}$
As an example, for water the specific and molar heat capacities are, respectively, $4.18J\cdot (°C)^{-1}\cdot g^{-1}$ and $75J\cdot K^{-1}\cdot mol^{-1}$.
