##### Heat transfers at constant pressure
In a closed vessel with constant volume, no expansion work is done. If no non-expansion work is done either $\Delta U=q_{V}$, where V signifies constant volume. More commonly in chemistry however, reactions take place in an open vessel with constant *pressure* (often atmospheric pressure). If a gas is produced it will expand against the pressure and expansion work is done. 
The state function for describing *loss of energy as expansion work during heat transfer under constant pressure* is **enthalpy**, *H*. *H* is described as:
$$H=U+PV$$

At constant pressure, with no non-expansion work: $\Delta H=q_{P}$, *P* signifies constant pressure.

When a system releases heat, as in an exothermic reaction:
$$q<0\Rightarrow\Delta H<0$$
Conversely, when a system absorbs heat, as in an endothermic reaction:
$$q>0\Rightarrow\Delta H>0$$

##### Heat capacities at constant volume and constant pressure
$q=C\Delta T$ describes the heat capacity. However, the rise in temperature and heat capacity depends on the *conditions* that the heating takes place. At constant pressure for example, some heat is used for expansion work as well as raising the temperature of the system. 
Assuming no non-expansion work and no other changes take place, $\Delta U=q$. Heat capacity under constant volume is thus:$$C_{V}=\frac{\Delta U}{\Delta T}$$
For heat capacity under constant pressure, change in enthalpy is used: $$C_{P}=\frac{\Delta H}{\Delta T}$$
Divided by the amount of substance, n, you get the corresponding molar heat capacities $C_{V,m}$ and $C_{P,m}$.

$$C_{P,m}=C_{V,m}+R$$

##### Enthalpy of physical change
Molecules in solids and liquids are held together by intermolecular attractions. A phase change where the attractions are reduced requires energy and are therefore endothermic. Phase changes that bring the molecules closer and increase interactions release energy and are exothermic. 
At a given temperature for a given substance, the vapour phase has a higher enthalpy than the liquid phase. The difference in molar enthalpy between the two states is the *enthalpy of vaporisation*: $$\Delta H_{vap}=H_{m,vapor}-H_{m,liquid}$$ Similarly there is the enthalpy of fusion (melting):$$\Delta H_{fus}=H_{m,liquid}-H_{m,solid}$$ The enthalpy of the reverse process is simply the negative of the forward process:$$\Delta H_{reverse}=-\Delta H_{forward}$$ It therefore follows that the enthalpy of, for example, freezing is simply the negative of the enthalpy of fusion:$$\Delta H_{freezing}=-\Delta H_{fus}$$ Sublimation is when a solid directly changes to vapour and its enthalpy is thus:$$\Delta H_{sub}=H_{m,vapor}-H_{m,solid}$$ Being a state function, there is no difference in enthalpies whether a solid sublimates or the same solid first melts and then vaporises. 
$$\Delta H_{sub}=\Delta H_{fus}+\Delta H_{vap}$$
