#### Reaction Enthalpy
Chemical reactions are associated with a change in energy, either released or absorbed.
Consider the combustion enthalpy of methane:
$$\ce
{CH_{4}(g) + 2O_{2}(g) \to CO_{2}(g) + 2H_{2}O(l)}
\qquad\Delta H = -890\ {kJ} $$




##### Relation between $\Delta H$ and $\Delta U$


Assuming an ideal gas:$$\Delta H=\Delta U+\Delta n_{gas}RT$$where $\Delta n_{gas}=n_2\left(g\right)-n_1\left(g\right)$.


##### Standard Reaction Enthalpies and Standard States
The heat released or absorbed in a chemical reactions depends on the physical states of each substance. For the combustion of ethene:
$$ \ce
{C_{2}H_{4}(g) + 3O_{2}(g) \to 2CO_{2}(g) + 2H_{2}O(g) \qquad \Delta H= -1323 kJ}
$$
$$ \ce
{C_{2}H_{4}(g) + 3O_{2}(g) \to 2CO_{2}(g) + 2H_{2}O(l) \qquad \Delta H= -1411 kJ}
$$
When water vapor is produced, heat is stored in the system to produce the vapor and the reaction enthalpy is lower when compared liquid water forming (compare to how heat must be added to a system to drive a phase transition).
The standard reaction enthalpy, $\Delta H^0$, is the reaction enthalpy of a reaction where reactants in their standard states form products also in their standard states. Standard states refers to when substances are in their pure form at exactly 1 bar. A solute is in its standard state when the concentration is 1 mol/L. A standard state of value $X$ is denoted $X^0$. 


Hess's Law:
$$\Delta H_{reaction}^0=\Sigma n_{p}\Delta H_{f,products}^0-\Sigma n_{r}\Delta H_{f,reactants}^0$$
The total enthalpy change for a chemical reaction does not depend on the pathway it takes. It only depends on the initial and final states.

It is based on the standard enthalpy of formation, $\Delta H_{f}^0$, which is the amount of heat lost or gained when one mole of a compound is formed from its constituent elements.

In order to determine the enthalpy of formation/reaction for a substance, caloremetry can be used. Calorimetry involves measuring the temperature change caused by a reaction which is related to the heat produced: $q=-C_{cal}\Delta T$.
$C_{cal}$ is the heat capacity of the calorimeter and so the heat is directly proportional to the temperature change. In the case of bomb calorimetry, where a substance is combusted in pure oxygen at constant volume, $q=\Delta U$, as no expansion work is made. The relation between heat and temperature can then be combined with the relation between $\Delta H$ and $\Delta U$ to obtain:
$$\Delta H_{c}=-C_{cal}\Delta T+\Delta n_{gas}RT$$
To obtain the standard enthalpy of combustion you divide by the amount of moles of the sample combusted.

$$\Delta H_{c}^0=\frac{\Delta H_{c}}{n}=\frac{\Delta H_{c}m}{M}$$
