##### Reaction Enthalpy


##### Relation between $\Delta H$ and $\Delta U$

Assuming an ideal gas:$$\Delta H=\Delta U+\Delta n_{gas}RT$$where $\Delta n_{gas}=n_2\left(g\right)-n_1\left(g\right)$.


Hess's Law:
$$\Delta H_{reaction}^0=\Sigma n_{p}\Delta H_{f,products}^0-\Sigma n_{r}\Delta H_{f,reactants}^0$$
The total enthalpy change for a chemical reaction does not depend on the pathway it takes. It only depends on the initial and final states.

It is based on the standard enthalpy of formation, $\Delta H_{f}^0$, which is the amount of heat lost or gained when one mole of a compound is formed from its constituent elements.

In order to determine the enthalpy of formation/reaction for a substance, caloremetry can be used. Calorimetry involves measuring the temperature change caused by a reaction which is related to the heat produced: $q=-C_{cal}\Delta T$.
$C_{cal}$ is the heat capacity of the calorimeter and so the heat is directly proportional to the temperature change. In the case of bomb calorimetry, where a substance is combusted in pure oxygen at constant volume, $q=\Delta U$, as no expansion work is made. The relation between heat and temperature can then be combined with the relation between $\Delta H$ and $\Delta U$ to obtain:
$$\Delta H_{c}=-C_{cal}\Delta T+\Delta n_{gas}RT$$
To obtain the standard enthalpy of combustion you divide by the amount of moles of the sample combusted.

$$\Delta H_{c}^0=\frac{\Delta H_{c}}{n}=\frac{\Delta H_{c}m}{M}$$
