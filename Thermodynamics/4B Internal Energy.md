### The First Law of Thermodynamics:
*"The internal energy of an isolated system is constant."*
$$\Delta U=q+w$$

##### State Functions
A state function is a property that only depends on the current state of a system and is therefore independent of the way it got there. An analogy is the altitude on a mountain. There are many different paths to get to a point at a certain altitude, but in the end you end up at the same altitude no matter which path was taken. 
Internal energy is a state function.
